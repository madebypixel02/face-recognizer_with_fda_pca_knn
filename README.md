# PCA, FDA, KNN Face Recognizer | uc3m

*Wait a minute... Who are you? üßê*

# Introduction

This is simply a little face recognizer which employs Principal Components Analysis, Fisher Discriminant Analysis, and K-Nearest Neighbors.
It was developed as part of our Data Science degree with [@chriss1245](https://github.com/chriss1245)

Note: This project is developed for educational purposes only. It should not be used otherwise.

## Limitations

- It can only recognize 25 faces labeled ``1`` to ``25`` (used as training set from the ``images`` folder). [Source](https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~spacelib/faces/faces96.html)

- If it can not recognize a face it will label it as ``0``.

- It only supports images with the same resolutions as the ones stored on the ``images`` folder.

Note: the main class is ``mda.R``, if you want to test it, edit the ``test_classifier.R`` file.
