# Introduction

<a href="https://github.com/madebypixel02/face-recognizer_with_fda_pca_knn/blob/master/Assignment%202%20Report.pdf">FULL REPORT HERE</a>

Little face recognizer which employs pca, fisher discriminant analysis, and knn. It was developed at the data science degree in UC3m with [@chriss1245](https://github.com/chriss1245)

This project is updated with educational purposes. It is far from being used practically.

- It can only recognize 25 faces which will be labeled with numbers from 1 to 25 (used as training set from the images folder.
Gotten here: https://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~spacelib/faces/faces96.html ).

- If it can not recognize a face it will label it a 0.

- It supports only images of the dimensions of the images in the folder 'images'.

Note: the main class es mda.R, if you want to test it, you should open the test_classifier.R file
